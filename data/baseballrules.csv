The Knickerbocker Rules -- the first surviving rules for the sport -- were codified in 1845 and make no mention of the pitching distance.

https://www.mlb.com/glossary/rules/field-dimensions,"It was not until the Baseball Convention of 1857 -- a meeting of 16 New York City area clubs -- that an official pitching distance was set. That same meeting was the first to establish the 90-foot distance between basepaths with which we are obviously familiar, but the pitching distance was set at 45 feet. The pitching area was marked by a 12-foot-long line, with the center of the line marked by a fixed circular iron plate. Pitchers were allowed to roam around, as long as the ball was delivered from behind the 12-foot line. In 1863, a pitcher’s box was effectively created with the addition of a second 12-foot line, 48 feet from home base. The pitcher, therefore, had to operate within that 3-foot space from front to back.",field-dimensions
https://www.mlb.com/glossary/rules/field-dimensions,"Over time, as pitchers began to experiment with speed and movement, the rules evolved to rein in their dominance. In 1881, it was Harry Wright, the so-called “Father of Professional Baseball” and organizer of the Cincinnati Red Stockings, who successfully proposed pushing back the pitching distance to 50 feet.",field-dimensions

In 1887 came a new dictum: Pitchers had to have their back foot in contact with the back line of the pitcher’s box, which by this point sat 5 1/2 feet behind the front line. That means pitchers were required to throw from a measurement of 55 feet, 6 inches from the now-square-shaped home base (the pentagonal shape was not introduced until 1900).",field-dimensions

https://www.mlb.com/glossary/rules/umpire,"A regular-season contest will have four umpires: one behind home plate and one stationed near each of the other three bases. Each umpire makes ""out"" or ""safe"" decisions at his designated base, and the home-plate umpire is responsible for calling balls and strikes on each pitch that is thrown. The first-base umpire determines whether batted balls were hit into fair or foul territory down the right-field line past the first-base bag, with the third-base umpire doing the same on balls hit down the left-field line beyond the third-base bag. Umpires at first and third base can also assist the home-plate umpire in determining whether a batter offered at a pitch or ""checked his swing."" If the latter is determined, a pitch outside the strike zone is recorded as a ball.",umpire

https://www.mlb.com/glossary/rules/umpire,"During postseason contests, Major League Baseball adds left-field and right-field umpires to help ensure accurate calls on baseballs hit down the fair/foul lines. Umpires stationed in the outfield can also assess if a batted ball hit in their vicinity was caught on the fly or trapped in a fielder's glove after bouncing on the grass.",umpire
https://www.mlb.com/glossary/rules/umpire,"Major League Baseball also employs replay officials -- full-time Major League umpires who work shifts in the Replay Command Center in New York. Replay officials review all calls subject to replay review and decide whether to change the call on the field, confirm the call on the field or let stand the call on the field due to the lack of clear and convincing evidence. Replay officials also work as on-field umpires during the season.",umpire

https://www.mlb.com/glossary/rules/warmup-pitches,"The time between innings is 2 minutes for both local broadcasts and nationally televised games in the regular season and 2 minutes, 55 seconds for postseason games. The umpire's signal for the final warmup pitch comes at the 25-second mark and the pitcher must throw it before the clock hits 20. The batter will be announced at the 20-second mark and the pitcher must begin his windup to throw the first pitch of the inning within the five seconds before the clock hits zero.",warmup-pitches
https://www.mlb.com/glossary/rules/warmup-pitches,"The timing clock also applies to pitching changes and begins as soon as the relief pitcher crosses the warning track (or the foul line for on-field bullpens). Players can be excused from these time limits if a delay in normal warmup activities occurs due to no fault of the players, or the umpire believes a player would be at legitimate risk of injury without receiving additional time.",warmup-pitches
https://www.mlb.com/glossary/rules/warmup-pitches,"For between-innings breaks, the timer begins when the final out of the inning is recorded, with several exceptions. If the pitcher is on base, on deck or at bat when the inning ends, the timer begins when the pitcher leaves the dugout for the mound. If the catcher is on base, on deck or at bat when the inning ends, the timer begins when the catcher enters the dugout (another catcher can begin warming up the pitcher). If the final out of the inning is subject to replay, the timer begins when the umpire signals the out. And for any extended between-innings event previously approved by the Office of the Commissioner (such as the playing of ""God Bless America""), the timer begins at the conclusion of the event.",warmup-pitches

https://www.mlb.com/glossary/rules/windup-position,"A pitcher is considered to be in the windup position when he puts his pivot foot on the pitching rubber and has both shoulders facing the batter to some degree. When starting his delivery from the windup position, a pitcher has the option to take a step back or to the side with his free foot. The pitcher then turns his pivot foot to be parallel to the pitching rubber, lifts his free leg up, pushes off the rubber with his pivot foot, strides toward the batter and delivers the pitch to the catcher.",windup-position
https://www.mlb.com/glossary/rules/windup-position,"The windup position is rarely used with runners on base, as the length of time needed to complete the windup makes pitchers more susceptible to stolen bases if using it with men on base.",windup-position
